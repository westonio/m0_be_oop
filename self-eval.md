# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
> It was both exciting and frustrating. It's exciting to be implementing so many things I learned this week and to know that there is soooo much more to learn. At the same time I was hit with many unexpected roadblocks in these challenges trying to figure out how to put them all together, and also overthinking things many times. 
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
> I believe I have a fairly good workflow in place. However, I would like to continue to explore utilizing the pomodora method to force myself to take a step away (this might help me from overthinking sometimes)
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
> I have learned that creating connections with my peers in the small groups has enabled us to all feel comfortable sharing tips, tricks, struggles, feedback, etc. So I would like to continue trying to foster relationships with everyone in my cohort. This will create an environment in which I feel we can all succeed.
